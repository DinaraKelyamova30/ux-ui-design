        <p>UI design and UX design are two of the most often confused and conflated terms in web and app design. And
            understandably so. They’re usually placed together in a single term, <ins>UI/UX design</ins>, and viewed
            from
            the surface
            they seem to be describing the same thing. It’s often hard to find solid descriptions of the two that don’t
            descend too far into jargon. But fear not!</p>
        <blockquote><b><i>What follows is an easy-to-digest primer on these terms.</i></b></blockquote>
        <p>By the end of this article, you’ll have a good understanding of what differentiates them and how they relate
            to
            each other. So let’s dive in!</p>
        <h2>What is UI Design?</h2>
        <p><i>The “UI” in UI design stands for “user interface.” </i>The user interface is the graphical layout of an
            application.
            It consists of the buttons users click on, the text they read, the images, sliders, text entry fields, and
            all
            the rest of the items the user interacts with. This includes screen layout, transitions, interface
            animations
            and every single micro-interaction.<b>Any sort of visual element, interaction, or animation must all be
                designed.</b>
        </p>

        <h2>UI vs. UX: Two Very Different Disciplines that Work in Harmony</h2>
        <p>UI design and UX design involve very different skill sets, but they are integral to each other’s success. A
            beautiful design can’t save an interface that’s clunky and confusing to navigate, and a brilliant,
            perfectly-appropriate user experience can be sunk by bad visual interface design that makes using the app
            unpleasant. Both UI and UX designs need to be flawlessly executed and perfectly aligned with pre-existing
            user expectations to create an excellent user interface/experience. And when those stars align the results
            can be astounding.</p>
